TODO:

Frontend
- Wireframe a new UI
- Implement new UI

Backend
- Use loadable config settings with flask
- do a test deploy, and set up update tooling on server

Logic
- Implement cropping,centering,normalization and some smarter calc logic

DONE:
- Check dataset for images, and see if model is overtrained
  - If model is overtrained, make new model and retrain
  * Yes, model is probably overtrained, but retraining properly will need a lot 
    of effort at this point. Push back.
